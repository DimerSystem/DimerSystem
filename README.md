# This is a computational package of bipartite field theory. Given any theory with the SL(2,Z) reduced 2-d toric diagram, the package is able to compute its corresponding dimer model, super-potential terms and quiver graph. 
# The package is brounght in along with the paper: XXXXXXXX TO BE FILLED IN XXXXXXX.

# How to use the package? 
# 1) Put it into a path which Mathematica would recognise (e.g. ~/Library/Mathematica/Applications).
# 2) Change the name to be only DimerSystem.m
# 3) Import the package as: <<DimerSystem`
# 4) ?DimerSystem will summarise the modules of the package.
# 5) ?<NameOfModule> will output the detailed usage of the module.
