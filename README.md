# This is a computational package of bipartite field theory. Given any theory with the SL(2,Z) reduced 2-d toric diagram, the package is able to compute its corresponding dimer model, super-potential terms and quiver graph. 
# The package is brounght in along with the paper: XXXXXXXX TO BE FILLED IN XXXXXXX.
