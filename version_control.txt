How to use the package? 
1) Put it into a path which Mathematica would recognise (e.g. ~/Library/Mathematica/Applications).
2) Change the name to be only DimerSystem.m
3) Import the package as: <<DimerSystem`
4) ?DimerSystem will summarise the modules of the package.
5) ?<NameOfModule> will output the detailed usage of the module.

What to improve about the package?
1) For the purpose of research, the code is purely in Mathematica style, namely it involves lots of virtual functions and compact coding (such as & @ # and their combinations). This might not look good for one who loves C++ and Python. If necessary we will make the code much more readable.

#### 0.0 - 2017/02/01
# Three versions of HiggsingDimerSU. 
# Fixed the following problem: when using Parallel functions in a package, must firstly distribute definitions into different kernels. 

#### 0.1 - 2017/02/01
# One version of HiggsingDimerSU. Chopped off the results of Zig-zag paths and consistency  flag.
# Requires documentation.

#### 0.2 - 2017/02/01
# Added on the simple usages of each module. 
# Need to read them again and add the description of the whole package and a demo.

#### 0.3 - 2017/02/02
# Re-written part of the documentation. Needs to fill in the paper information.
# Added on a module DemonDimer[], used to guide the user by a simple example.
